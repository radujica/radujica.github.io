experiences:
    - role: (Big) Data Engineer
      time: Jan 2019 - Present
      company: Unit8 SA, Zürich
      details: |
        Integrated data into an entity resolution pipeline on Foundry and 
        optimized its execution through Apache Spark by 20%. Developed 
        monitoring tools and metrics to analyze and evaluate its performance; 
        these prompted several fixes to increase the recall of the matches up to 95%. 
        Responsible for maintaining and scheduling this together with other pipelines 
        to ensure fresh data reaches users as soon as possible. In direct contact 
        with the clients for requirements and the design of additional features 
        such as historization.
    - role: Database Architectures Traineeship
      time: Jan 2018 - Aug 2018
      company: CWI, Amsterdam
      details: |
        Worked on optimizing data analysis pipelines as part of the Masters Thesis. 
        Focused particularly on the Weld lazy optimizing framework from Stanford 
        by evaluating it's performance and pros/cons. This work led to introducing 
        intermediate results and lazy file parsing to Weld through a framework 
        implemented in Python. These additions were used alongside Weld to build 
        a library consisting of a small subset of Pandas.
    - role: Software Development Engineer Intern
      time: Jun 2017 - Sep 2017
      company: Amazon, Edinburgh
      details: |
        Designed and implemented in Java an automated process to fetch, process, 
        and store hierarchical data while ensuring maintainability and extension 
        in the future. This automation brought the missing 30% of the data to 
        current use while offering an effective approval process for any future 
        data. Furthermore, have gathered insights into customer behavior and 
        interests through big data analysis in Spark with Scala.
